CPP Notes:
What is C++?
C++ is a General Purpose Programming language that is based on C to develop various kinds of Applications using simple and English based Commands that can be easily understood and developed. 
A General Purpose programming language is one which allows to develop different kinds of Applications: Desktop based(Calculator, Data centric Applications), OS Based(Device components), System Based(Smart Devices) Applications. However, we cannot develop Web Centric Apps in C++. 
It is based on C Language. Many of the syntax is similar to C. C++ is an extension of C with a very popular feature called OOPs.
It is middle level language: it is not a low level machine kind of programming or a high level interpretor based language. It will hide both high level language features as well as low level language features. 

How to develop a C++ Program?
We write our programs using Text Editors and save the files with extension .cpp. We are supposed to compile this file(A program to convert the English language code into a language that is understood by the Computer) and would generate some instructions to the computer which will simply follow it(OBEY it). 
Programs are instructions written in human compatible languages. U need a programming langauge  to write such programs. C++ is one such programming language and one of the popular programming languages in the Computing world.
The language that Computer understands is MACHINE LANGUAGE. This language consists of set of instructions made of 0s and 1s. Anything that U want to instruct to the Computer will finally be presented as combinations of 0s and 1s to the computer.

Execution process of a C++ Program:
.CPP Files --->Compiler == .obj Files(Compilation Process)
.obj Files---->Linker == .EXE File:(Building Process) This is what is the file that contains the instructions to the Computer. 

Features of a CPP Program:
Simple: As the program is broken down into small logical units and parts, the program looks simple and easy to maintain. 
Machine independent code: Code that is developed is machine independent but not platform independent.(Compiled programs in Windows dont work in Linux). Any machine can compile and run the CPP Application. 
Mid Level language: We can develop System level programming(Drivers, Kernels, Networking) and at the same time build High level User Applications like Media Players, Editors, PhotoShop, Game Software etc).
Speed of Execution: C++ programs are tested to be executed faster compared to many other programming languages. Many OS are written in C and C++ is a superset of C, so execution within the OS is faster compared to other OOP couterpart languages. Newer languages like Java and C# are slower as they have extra features like Garbage collection, dynamic Typecasting which makes the programming easier but the execution slower. 
Rich Library support: C++ has many inbuilt APIs as well as 3rd party libraries to develop the Applications in a faster and reliable manner. 

Some interesting facts about C++:
The name C++ is C with ++ which is an incremental operator in C. 
C++ was till recently the most dominant programming language for developing all kinds of technical and commercial Software.
C++ was the first programming language that made OOP popular.(Simula67 was the first OOP language).
A function by name "main" is the minimal requirement for any C++ Program to run. 

Environment Setup:
U could install the C++ Editors and Compilers on various platforms. 
Unix platforms:
Use any text editors and use the GCC Compiler that is available with every unix machines. 
sudo apt-get install GCC: Command to install the GCC Compiler on UR System.
sudo apt-get install build-essential: Installs the libraries required to run C++ Programs. 
g++ example.cpp -o exampleOutput
./exampleOutput : to execute the program.
------------------------------------------
Windows platforms:
Many IDEs are available for Windows to create and run C++ programs. 
Prominent ones: Dev C++(Open source), Eclipse, Visual Studio to name a few. 
Simply install the software and start using the IDE like any other Text editor with options to compile, build and execute. 
-----------------------------------------------
Mac OS X: 
U should download XCode from the Apple Store. XCode App is the IDE for developing C++ as well as Objective C programs.
